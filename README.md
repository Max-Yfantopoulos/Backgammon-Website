## About the Project

This project is a web-based implementation of the classic board game **Backgammon**. It allows users to:
- Play against an AI opponent.
- Play multiplayer games with another user.
- View the current game state, including dice rolls, player turns, and checker positions.

The backend handles the game logic and state management, while the frontend provides an interactive user interface.
